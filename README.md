# KI18n

KDE Gettext-based UI text internationalization

## Introduction

KI18n provides functionality for internationalizing user interface text
in applications, based on the GNU Gettext translation system.
It wraps the standard Gettext functionality, so that the programmers
and translators can use the familiar Gettext tools and workflows.

KI18n provides additional functionality as well, for both programmers
and translators, which can help to achieve a higher overall quality
of source and translated text. This includes argument capturing,
customizable markup, and translation scripting.
